# CNN-From-Scratch-Using-Python

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch using Python and NumPy. CNNs are a class of deep learning models designed primarily for image data. They are widely used for image classification, object detection, and other tasks involving visual data. In this project, we build and train a CNN model without using deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, focusing on understanding the underlying mathematics and operations.
